- ALWAYS write unit tests in the src directory in each file with the code that theyâ€™re testing. The convention is to create a module named tests in each file to contain the test functions and to annotate the module with cfg(test).
- ALWAYS run `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features` and `cargo t` after making changes.
- Once code is working, format the code using `cargo fmt`
